Problem

Use indoor positioning systems to improve the efficiency and accuracy of feedback offered by a coach 
to their players - set teams - during a real-time match.

Hot Idea

The idea of the project is to provide a tool to help the demanding needs of today's sportsmen, where 
technology has become a fundamental part of the decision-making by the coaching staff in any kind of sport. 
Being able to provide feedback in real time and give a more global view on the positioning of players on the 
pitch is the main functionality of this system.

Technology

ToA (time of arrival) it's the time it takes for a radio signal to travel from a transmitter to a single remote 
receiver. This synchronization can be done in different ways:
* With an exact synchronization of watches on both sides. The imprecision in the synchronization of the clocks 
directly translates an inaccurate location.
* Without direct synchronization, but with clock compensation by phase difference.
