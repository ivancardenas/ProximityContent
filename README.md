Use indoor positioning systems to improve the efficiency and accuracy of feedback offered by a coach 
to their players - set teams - during a real-time match.

Hot Idea

The idea of the project is to provide a tool to help the demanding needs of today's sportsmen, where 
technology has become a fundamental part of the decision-making by the coaching staff in any kind of sport. 
Being able to provide feedback in real time and give a more global view on the positioning of players on the 
pitch is the main functionality of this system.

Technology

They are essentially tiny, low power computers attached to walls or objects in the physical world. Using proximity 
technologies they detect human presence and behavior and trigger pre-programmed actions delivering contextual and
personalized experiences.
